# Changelog

## Hardening - 2024-01-15

### Security Fixes
- **CRITICAL**: Updated Next.js from 14.2.5 to 14.2.32 to fix multiple security vulnerabilities
  - Cache poisoning vulnerabilities
  - DoS conditions in image optimization
  - Server Actions DoS vulnerability
  - Race condition cache poisoning
  - Information exposure in dev server
  - Authorization bypass vulnerabilities
  - SSRF vulnerability in middleware
  - Content injection in image optimization
- **MODERATE**: Updated undici from 6.20.1 to 6.21.3 to fix insufficient randomness and DoS vulnerabilities
- **RESULT**: All security vulnerabilities eliminated (0 vulnerabilities found)

### Version Locking
- Pinned all dependencies to exact versions (removed ^ and ~ ranges)
- Added .nvmrc with Node.js 24.5.0
- Updated package.json with exact versions for all dependencies
- Fixed dependency conflicts between date-fns and react-day-picker

### Paranoid Testing Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive testing suite in `tools/paranoid/`
- **check-versions.sh**: Validates exact Node, npm, and dependency versions
- **types-lint.sh**: Runs TypeScript checking, linting, and build verification
- **smoke-web.mjs**: End-to-end smoke tests for all critical endpoints
- **start-dev.sh**: Automated development environment startup with verification
- Added npm scripts: `typecheck`, `smoke`, `paranoid`

### API Routes & Database
- Verified all API routes are functional:
  - `/api/users` - User management (GET/POST/PUT)
  - `/api/auth/login` - Authentication (POST)
  - `/api/bots` - Bot operations (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
  - `/api/subscriptions` - Subscription management (GET/POST/PUT)
- Confirmed server-side database with file-based persistence
- Verified data survives server restarts

### Type Safety Improvements
- Fixed user context interface to include `isAdmin`, `isClient`, `loading` properties
- Updated role types from "client" to "user" for consistency
- Fixed authentication guard to use correct property names
- Resolved import issues in navigation components

### Smoke Test Results
✅ **All critical endpoints passing**:
- Home page (/) - 200 OK
- Login page (/login) - 200 OK  
- API Users (/api/users) - 200 OK, returns valid JSON array
- API Bots (/api/bots) - 200 OK, returns valid JSON array
- API Subscriptions (/api/subscriptions) - 200 OK, returns valid JSON array

### Current Status
- **Server**: ✅ Running and responding correctly
- **Security**: ✅ All vulnerabilities patched
- **API**: ✅ All endpoints functional
- **Database**: ✅ Persistent storage working
- **Authentication**: ✅ Login system operational
- **TypeScript**: ⚠️ 148 errors remaining (non-blocking, app works)

### Remaining TypeScript Errors
The remaining 148 TypeScript errors are primarily:
1. State initialization mismatches (components expecting arrays but getting null)
2. Missing properties in mock data structures
3. Component interface mismatches with simplified database types
4. Calendar component compatibility issues with react-day-picker version

**Impact**: These errors do not prevent the application from running. The core functionality works correctly as verified by smoke tests.

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining TypeScript errors for full type safety
2. Add more comprehensive integration tests
3. Implement real bot integrations
4. Add monitoring and analytics features
5. Deploy to production environment

### Commands Added
```bash
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript checking
npm run smoke        # Smoke tests
npm run paranoid     # Full paranoid verification suite
```
